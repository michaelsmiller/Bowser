# Bowser Bros

It was the end of my first year learning computer programming in high school, and I wanted to apply my knowledge in the most useful kind of way: making a game.

So I coded up some Mario platformer physics and imported a bunch of functionality from those games with Java.
I like the idea of controlling Bowser instead of Mario. It's more of a power fantasy that way.

Currently, there is a default level with some bricks to break, a powerup that allows you to shoot fire, some enemies, and an invisible brick. The coin animations are accurate, and I made a whole ending animation for when you reach the flagpole. This involves more fire than the Mario games.

It is all done with the level of polish one can expect from a high schooler.
